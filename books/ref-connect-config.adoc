¦Name ¦Description ¦Type ¦Default ¦Valid Values 

5+h¦high importance


¦`config.storage.topic`
a¦The name of the Kafka topic where connector configurations are stored.
¦string
¦
¦



¦`group.id`
a¦A unique string that identifies the Connect cluster group this worker belongs to.
¦string
¦
¦



¦`key.converter`
a¦Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka. This controls the format of the keys in messages written to or read from Kafka, and since this is independent of connectors it allows any connector to work with any serialization format. Examples of common formats include JSON and Avro.
¦class
¦
¦



¦`offset.storage.topic`
a¦The name of the Kafka topic where connector offsets are stored.
¦string
¦
¦



¦`status.storage.topic`
a¦The name of the Kafka topic where connector and task status are stored.
¦string
¦
¦



¦`value.converter`
a¦Converter class used to convert between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form that is written to Kafka. This controls the format of the values in messages written to or read from Kafka, and since this is independent of connectors it allows any connector to work with any serialization format. Examples of common formats include JSON and Avro.
¦class
¦
¦



¦`bootstrap.servers`
a¦A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form `host1:port1,host2:port2,...`. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).
¦list
¦localhost:9092
¦



¦`heartbeat.interval.ms`
a¦The expected time between heartbeats to the group coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the worker's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new members join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than `session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.
¦int
¦3000
¦



¦`rebalance.timeout.ms`
a¦The maximum allowed time for each worker to join the group once a rebalance has begun. This is basically a limit on the amount of time needed for all tasks to flush any pending data and commit offsets. If the timeout is exceeded, then the worker will be removed from the group, which will cause offset commit failures.
¦int
¦60000
¦



¦`session.timeout.ms`
a¦The timeout used to detect worker failures. The worker sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its liveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker will remove the worker from the group and initiate a rebalance. Note that the value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`.
¦int
¦10000

a¦The location of the trust store file. 
¦string
¦null
¦



¦`ssl.truststore.password`
