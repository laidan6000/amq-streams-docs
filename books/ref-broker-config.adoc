5+h¦high importance


¦`zookeeper.connect`
a¦Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form `hostname:port` where host and port are the host and port of a ZooKeeper server. To allow connecting through other ZooKeeper nodes when that ZooKeeper machine is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form `hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3`.
The server can also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of its ZooKeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. For example to give a chroot path of `/chroot/path` you would give the connection string as `hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path`.

¦`advertised.host.name`
a¦DEPRECATED: only used when `advertised.listeners` or `listeners` are not set. Use `advertised.listeners` instead. 
Hostname to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use. In IaaS environments, this may need to be different from the interface to which the broker binds. If this is not set, it will use the value for `host.name` if configured. Otherwise it will use the value returned from java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().

In the latest message format version, records are always grouped into batches for efficiency. In previous message format versions, uncompressed records are not grouped into batches and this limit only applies to a single record in that case.

¦`min.insync.replicas`
a¦When a producer sets acks to "all" (or "-1"), min.insync.replicas specifies the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful. If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will raise an exception (either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend).
When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write.

¦`listener.security.protocol.map`
a¦Map between listener names and security protocols. This must be defined for the same security protocol to be usable in more than one port or IP.

Concretely, the user could define listeners with names INTERNAL and EXTERNAL and this property as: `INTERNAL:SSL,EXTERNAL:SSL`. As shown, key and value are separated by a colon and map entries are separated by commas. Each listener name should only appear once in the map. Different security (SSL and SASL) settings can be configured for each listener by adding a normalised prefix (the listener name is lowercased) to the config name. For example, to set a different keystore for the INTERNAL listener, a config with name `listener.name.internal.ssl.keystore.location` would be set. If the config for the listener name is not set, the config will fallback to the generic config (i.e. `ssl.keystore.location`).
